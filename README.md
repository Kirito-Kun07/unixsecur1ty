These Scripts were Modified and Created by Diego Cruz, Francis Polytechnic High, CA, USA.

These Linux/Ubuntu Security Scripts are seperated in the case that the image gets corrupted, and the 
competitor can easily see what went wrong and fix it.

I would you to go reccommened in the following order if you are using all of them:
<p>1. Read README</p>  
<p>2. Do Forensic Questions</p>
<p>3. Harden_Defensive_Countermeasures.sh</p>

However, in the end you can use them in whichever order you want.
<p>Just make sure the scripts don't interfere with the Forensic Questions!!<p>

Enjoy, and Good Luck Future Nationalist!

Intructions to how to run scripts:
<p>chmod +x <script_name>    -Will give execution permissions</p>
<p>./<script_name>		  -Will execute script</p>

Example:
<p>chmod +x main.sh</p>
<p>./main.sh</p>


Extra Notes:
The script known as "The_Last_Stand.sh". As a last chance resort script it contains commands with programs being uninstalled and
configurations that I was unsure would mess the Operating system due to not fully understanding or gut feeling.
Thus I recommend doing this as a last chance to get points if lost, strategy
